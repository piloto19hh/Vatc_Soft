In "docs" folder, there must be all the airports' information documents. For each different airport there must be:
1- SIDs document. It'll be named 'ICAOSID.txt', replacing ICAO with the airport's ICAO code.
2- SARs document. It'll be named 'ICAOSTAR.txt', replacin ICAO with the airport's ICAO cose.

Those documents will have all the necessary information about each airport. This is: number of runways, the runways' names and the
number of possible arrival(STAR)/departure(SID) routes, followed by all the routes in the format: point name and arr/dep name.

Important: If one runway has more routes than another, fill the one with less routes with "NULL NULL". 

Check for an example in LEPASID and LEPASTAR for the airport LEPA (Palma de Mallorca).
