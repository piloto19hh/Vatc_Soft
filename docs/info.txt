1- SIDs document. It'll be named 'ICAOSID.txt', replacing ICAO with the airport's ICAO code.
2- SARs document. It'll be named 'ICAOSTAR.txt', replacin ICAO with the airport's ICAO cose.

Those documents will have all the necessary information about each airport. This is: number of runways, the runways' names and the
number of possible arrival/departure routes , followed by it's point name and arr/dep name.
